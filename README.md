Ubuntu linux post install script to make life easier

You simply have to run the script as sudo adn the script will prompt you to let you decide what packet manager do you want to use (e.g yum, apt), what web server do you want to install (e.g apache2, nginx) and what db server do you want to install (e.g mariadb, mysql, firebase...)

Anything revolutionary just winning some time with installation
