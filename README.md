Ubuntu linux post install script to make life easier

You simply have to run the script as sudo adn the script will prompt you to let you decide what web server you want to install (e.g apache2, nginx) and what db server do you want (e.g mariadb, mysql, firebase...)

Anything revolutionary just winning some time
